    <p><h2>Hey, There!</br></h2>
      Young Tony Stark was a prodigy of mechanical engineering genius. At 21, he took over his
        father's company and launched it into a hugely successful corporation. During a testing of new technology in
        Vietnam, Tony was hit by a piece of shrapnel from a booby trap. The shrapnel was lodged near his heart and
        without help, Tony would die. There, he was captured by a communist leader and imprisoned, forced to make new
        weapons for the overlord. Also imprisoned with him was Professor Ho Yinsen, a renowned physicist. Together they
        built the first suit of armor that would become Iron Man. Professor Ho even made the chest plate of the armor
        with a device to help Tonyâ€™s heart keep beating.
